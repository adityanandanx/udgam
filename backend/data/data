End intern. She outperformed experienced UI/UX designers and developers combined.  "i will not promote"
A few months back, we were hiring for a front-end role. We received over 600 applications and shortlisted 100. Instead of diving into long interviews or sending out take-home assignments, we did something simple.   "i will not promote" 

We shared a 5-page study doc on the basics of UX, just enough to level the playing field. Then we spent 15 minutes with each person, asking twisted conceptual questions based only on that material. That’s all it took.

It gave everyone a sort of  fair shot. And from their answers, we could immediately see who could learn fast, think deeply, and apply creatively.

The thing is, startups can’t afford to hire for knowledge. There’s a disproportionate premium on it in the market, and big companies can pay that. Most startups simply can’t.

But what we can do is bet on potential. On people who pick things up quickly, who care about what they build, and who are kind and driven enough to work well with others.

What I really dislike is when companies give out long assignments or ask candidates to work with internal boilerplate codes and call it “assessment.” That’s not assessment, it’s disguised exploitation. You’re asking someone to work for free without hiring them. And the worst part is, the candidate can’t even say anything because the power dynamics are too skewed. One side is offering a job, the other is just hoping.

That’s why our approach worked so well.

Out of 100 candidates, ten stood out. One of them was still in college. I was skeptical. Our CTO insisted. She joined as an intern.

And she’s now outperforming people with years of experience. Not because she knew everything, but because she learned fast, executed consistently, and took feedback without ego.

It sounds like common sense, but only once you’ve lived through it.

Startups should optimize for learning ability, not experience. And the smartest ones do it in ways that are humane, fair, and simple.

That’s the only hiring framework we follow, and it’s worked beautifully.

Curious to know how others approach hiring in early-stage teams. What has worked for you

 






2. I built a VC Translator app that converts what VCs say into what they actually mean. Raising a trillion dollars now. I will not promote.
After years of being gaslit by venture capitalists, I've finally built the tool the startup ecosystem desperately needs: a VC Translator.

The MVP only translates 20 phrases so far, but that's because VCs only know about 20 phrases total. We'll add more once they expand their vocabulary beyond "interesting approach" and "let's keep in touch."

Our go-to-market strategy is simple: we're going to burn $100M on billboard ads in Menlo Park and Sand Hill Road, then pivot to enterprise SaaS when that doesn't work.

Currently raising 1 trillion dollars to buy a domain.

Our current metrics are incredibly promising - we have 0 users, 0 revenue, and a 100% likelihood of being acquired by Microsoft for no apparent reason.

If you're a VC interested in investing, please know that we're oversubscribed but might make an exception for a strategic partner who brings value beyond capital.

This subreddit doesn't let me put links. Because they're afraid of competition. App is vc-translator dot vercel dot app (replace the dot with actual dot).

3. My startup is dead (I will not promote)
After 1.5 years of work to stand up a new medical services company, the whole thing has imploded. 

I’m sitting here in the middle of the night trying to rest but it’s a hard moment to drift off into dream land so I would rather write on it. 

I rewrote this quite a few times and I I’ll just go with a simple list of reasons why: 

1) Me: yes, me. At the end of the day as ceo and founder the life of the company and its survival are based on my actions and choices. Not just on past experiences (I have started other smaller companies, worked for big ones) but on how you plot out the goals for your company in the first years and months. 

And while we had some goals, I was never a harsh bulldozer to make them happen. I wanted to always be nice and I always wanted to give myself space but the just let to burn and bleeding of cash. 

Once you’re truly on your own as the leader of a company it feels very different. You need to move with a new urgency and act as if you’re already under a gun and the product is real. Too many times I didn’t do that. 

2) Cofounder- i never really found the right number 2. The medical experts involved always wanted one leg in and one out. This just created endless conflict and meant I was often left on my own to clean up messes. 

Make no compromises here. The other person is either on or out. 

3) Money- that is, money properly set against runway. This is not just about salary or buying computers or Klayvio: it’s about knowing the drop dead date by which you need to be profitable or starting to raise. We kept push all those dates back and started each new step in the process too late.

VCs are slow. They control the process and there is only so much false urgency you can drop on their heads. 

It took by my last count 509 emails to get to 3 second round VC meetings. A process that took so so so much longer than I assumed. 

As the runway dwindled it just wasn’t possible to pay money to keep waiting for VCs to schedule meetings. 

4) signal to noise: there’s too many blogs, too many LinkedIn people, too many coach’s and newsletter guys. Too many podcasts and sales tools. You get lost in it and reading some Paul graham essay can’t make your product better. Too many people who don’t build but have a great way for you to build because how you’re doing it is wrong. 

Next time, I’ll just stick with biographies. Next time I will block out all of that garbage.  

5) Honesty- I was never direct enough or honest enough with my team or my employees. I was too eager to please and be liked. To be different from my shitty bosses. 

This was a huge disservice to the whole squad. Just be direct and be open and don’t worry before you speak about how you’ll make them feel. 

Be open and honest ever step. 

Anyway, that’s it. This isn’t a paid substack so you don’t get jazzy prose just a rough list. 

Thanks for reading.

4. Why is everyone still worshipping PhDs like they’re gods of wisdom? (I will not promote)
No hate to folks with a PhD—mad respect if you’re actually pushing the boundaries of knowledge—but can we please stop pretending a PhD automatically makes you the smartest person in the room?

I’ve worked with PhDs who overthink every fucking thing. Want to ship a feature? “Let’s spend 3 weeks doing a literature review.” Need a quick PoC? “We should evaluate 10 theoretical frameworks first.” Meanwhile, someone with half-decent instincts and real product sense could’ve shipped a working version in 3 days.

And the worst part? Everyone just nods along because “oooh they have a PhD.” Like bro, I get it—you suffered for five years in academia. That doesn’t make your solution scalable, practical, or even usable in the real world.

In my case, we’ve got a PhD making 400K a year. No major deliverables. No groundbreaking research. Just never-ending theoretical opinions that get rubber-stamped because of the title. One of their big “contributions” was literally a weighted average—a task I’d expect from a mid-level analyst at best. As someone from a startup background, this is just insane to me.

I’m just over it. I want to work with doers, not people trying to build utopian systems that collapse the second they touch reality.

Anyone else seeing this in their workplace? Or know any subreddits where execution actually matters more than academic ego? Looking for some rants and advise.






5. 5 Brutal Questions I Ask Before Building Any Startup Idea (After 3 Companies + $150M Combined Value) - I will not promote
After building three startups — two of which hit product-market fit, and one that scaled to $20M in the bank — I’ve noticed a pattern:

**Most failed startups didn’t fail because of tech. Or funding. Or competition.**

They failed because the *founder chose the wrong problem to solve*.

Too often we chase trends, pick surface-level problems, or build stuff we’d never use ourselves.

So I started using a 5-question filter before committing to any idea:

**1. Do I genuinely care about this problem?**  
If not, I’ll quit the second it gets hard. And it *will* get hard.

**2. Will this keep me excited and growing?**  
If there’s no flow, no learning curve, and no challenge, I lose momentum fast.

**3. Will this destroy my health?**  
A high-stress business model with no leverage is a time bomb. I avoid it early.

**4. Will this make real money?**  
Not just traffic or “users” — actual, sustainable revenue from a real customer.

**5. Does this play to my unique edge?**  
I won’t win where I have no advantage. I focus on problems I’ve lived, or spaces I understand deeply.

This filter has saved me *years* of building the wrong thing.

It’s also helped me guide other founders — especially first-timers — toward ideas they can actually stick with, scale, and make profitable.

If you're about to commit to an idea, take 10 minutes and walk through these honestly.

Would love to hear if you’ve used a similar filter — or if there's a question you always ask before building.

6. Sequoia Capital called ME to Pitch - and I Blew It (I will not promote)
So many moons ago I was running an online automotive marketplace that was doing fairly well, but hadn't taken any funding.

One day I get a call from Roelof Botha, who some of you know is the Managing Partner of Sequoia.  But back then (this is 2003-ish) he was just an associate pounding the phones looking for deals, and he came across my company.

Up until this point I had never raised a penny in my life, but I knew exactly who Sequoia was, and when he called and asked if we were raising my answer was basically "Sure, if you're investing..."  I would imagine they get a lot of that.

They wanted me to fly from Columbus, Ohio to their offices on Sand Hill Road.  I knew absolutely nothing about what it meant to prep a pitch deck (which is ironic because I now help people with this for a living) or how to answer any questions, but I was really good at face-to-face sales because I had run an ad agency for a decade.

I fly to Menlo Park and show up wearing a suit - mistake one.  I was used to big agency pitches where people still wore suits to presentations (back then).  I looked like I was going to church, or a funeral.. or any event but a Silicon Valley VC pitch.  It did not go un-noticed.

The moment the meeting started, Roelof, who BTW is one of the kindest guys in VC, told me how much he appreciated me flying all the way out and how he had asked another partner if he'd join us.  But not just any partner - the partner - the legendary Mike Moritz.  Mike's list of deals could fill a NASCAR car - Google, Yahoo!, PayPal, Linkedin - all the darlings of that era.

Mike Moritz, as it happens, s NOT the kindest guy in VC.  He immediately laid into me with no hesitation and started asking questions that at the time I had never heard "So what are you doing with your CPA? (Cost per Acquisition, we call it "CAC" now) and my answer was "We don't have a CPA, currently"  I literally thought he meant who is our accountant.  That did not go over well.

Mike was very clear about how unprepared and incompetent I was.  While feeling humiliated I also thought "Dude, you called ME".  But I persisted.  I explained how quickly our metrics were improving (even if I apparently didn't know what they were called...) and that I thought this could be a billion dollar company, if not more.  I think they saw a glimmer of hope, but quickly showed me the door anyway.  I assumed that was the end of it.

On my way back to my airport hotel next to SFO, ready to head home, Roelof calls me and says "They really liked what they saw - we want you to come to the partner's meeting on Monday if you're willing to stay the weekend."

I was shocked.  It was maybe the worst feeling I had ever had coming out of a sales meeting and I had been on hundreds.

Regardless, I showed up on Monday ready to give it a second shot.  I had never been to a partners meeting, and I had no idea what that meant or the significance.  It would be like getting invited to play in the SuperBowl but you didn't really know what football was.

The partner meeting is where ALL of the partners of the firm show up to get pitched together.  It's the big show.  I got up there in my out-of-place suit, and fired away about the future of this startup.

That's when one of the partners, Mark Kvamme, simply asked "So how are you looking at your TAM?"  (For those that aren't familiar, "TAM" means Total Addressable Market and it means how many people could possibly buy your product, even if not all of them bought from you.)

I had no goddamn clue what a "TAM" was.  I panicked, and I did I what I had learned when I was coming up in the agency business in my early 20's - I flipped the question.

"Before I dig in, can you give me a sense for how you're looking at it, so I'm answering the question properly?"  The idea there is to see if they will give you some context clues before you completely bomb out.  Mark didn't take the bait - "No, just tell me how you're seeing it."

Totally f\*cked.  When you sit in front of arguably the smartest, most successful VC's in the world, you probably should know what your goddamn market size is.  I didn't even know what the term for my market size was.  (bc life is weird, Kvamme and I would end up re-connecting years later when he moved to Columbus, Ohio of all places).

I've been in a lot of big pitches prior to that, and some way bigger than this, but I don't think I've ever seen the sheer disdain from a group of people that I saw on the faces of the people in that room, at that moment.  I truly earned that reaction.

They were very professional, but I'm well aware when I've completely bombed, it usually happens when you see each of the people on the other side of the table exchange glances, and then collectively agree that you should get the hell out of the room.

Roelof dutifully escorted me out, past what has to be the biggest collection of "tombstones" (investment banker speak for 'companies we took IPO or had a huge sale') that I've ever seen in my life.  It was like a reminder of who I wouldn't become.

On my way back home, he called and informed me that Sequoia would not be investing "in this round" (beautiful phrasing btw) and how much they would love to stay in touch.  I've been told "no" from nearly every VC that's out there at some point in my career, but to this day, no one made me feel better about it than he did.  I've always held so much respect for that, because it's not an easy call to make.

So, I went back to my little corner of the world and just kept bootstrapping.  The company would go on to be very profitable and still privately held today (not by me).  I would go on to start 3 more venture funded companies (incidentally, none by Sequoia...)

I share this for those of you who are fundraising for the first time - I do this for a living (31 years as a startup Founder) and have helped other startups raise over a billion dollars, and I still didn't know jack shit going into this - there's no reason you would either!

I also share this with my fellow Founders who may have gone through this same experience and can appreciate what it feels to get completely shut down on the pitch.

It happens to all of us.

Side note - Soon after meeting with me, Roelof would meet the Founders of YouTube and land his first major investment, which apparently went better than mine, and is what put him on the track to become Managing Partner he is today.

7. I run a fully remote startup. This is how we communicate across different time zones. (I will not promote)
Since Covid, I've been working remotely, most of it through startups I've created. Never had an office, and no tracking apps for my employees. We only have Google Meet calls once a week for sprint planning. My team has changed over the years, but I've worked with people in over a dozen countries (US, Croatia, Ukraine, Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, UK)

I want to share what I've learned and worked for us so far: 

The most effective way for remote teams to work is to minimize meetings and get better with clear, concise communication, given the limits of a global team.

With the power of AI, our team has recently significantly improved how we communicate.

Here are some ways we're effectively communicating within our team and clients globally:

1. **Single source of truth**

In previous companies, documentation, task management, and resources were all in different places. My team now only uses one software to manage all of this, including client-facing touchpoints like project tracking and messaging. This avoids hunting for necessary information. It might be hard to consolidate and find the perfect software to do this. Still, if you do, it'll help a lot because search is quicker, the team is more in sync, and some even give a bird's eye view of the company, similar to your traditional project management software. 

Additionally, some apps allow you to create siloed information systems to which you can expose your clients to.

2. **Async updates**

Our team has now embedded the use of video recording communications for both internal and external communications. Suppose you have completed a task requiring communication with a client or team member. In that case, we always attach a video and screen recording going over the update, just like how you'd do when presenting to a client or bringing a team member up to date by going over their desk and talking about it.

This removes scheduling meetings for every update, eliminating guesswork or the need to determine things from the comms sent. This method drastically reduced impromptu meetings.

3. **Effective meetings**

We now only meet once a week to sprint plan and brainstorm. Outside of that, everything else is async. We also use AI notetakers for internal and external meetings, which helps a ton when extracting tasks and priorities.

My personal workflow is:

\- Meeting + AI note taker  
\- Download the meeting transcript and feed it to an AI chat.  
\- Ask it to extract tasks identified during the call, priorities, sometimes... even product requirements documents (invaluable when talking to clients)

I know there's a lot of discussion of returning to the office vs. working remotely, but I thought I'd share how my remote team is making it work. 

If you have a remote team, these systems will be beneficial. For us, they allowed us to deliver more for our clients because we spent less time on meetings, calls, etc., and even with that, our team and clients walked away with the information they needed without further assistance.

Hopefully, this helps further the desire for remote teams.

8. If You Have Under 10,000 Users, Stop Wasting Money on Ads and Do This (i will not promote)
I will not promote

You’ve got to stop spending money on Google Ads if you have under 10,000 users. All it does in your early stages is suck your money like a vacuum.

Screw Google Ads.  
  
Screw Meta Ads.  
  
Screw TikTok Ads.  
  
Screw Reddit Ads (maybe they’re okay).

To get those 10,000 users, go for contextual advertising, to the places where your ideal customers hang out, NOT where they MIGHT be. You’ve got to go straight for it like a sniper.

Where do you find your ideal customers?  
  
If you have a marketing startup, you need to hit up blogs/websites giving marketing tips.  
  
Or target newsletters talking about marketing.  
  
Or go for micro-service tools in your niche.

Because if those pages have 10,000 visits, those 10,000 visits are yours. They come knowing what they want to see, making it 10 times easier to convert.

Set up a solid mention/banner on that site, and you’ll convert like crazy.

The ROI is way higher with contextual advertising.

Literally, with $50 bucks, you can sponsor a blog with over 20,000 monthly visits.






9. Unpopular Opinion: Building MVPs Without Validation Isn’t a Mistake - I will not promote
I know the startup playbook says validate before you build. Talk to customers. Find problems worth solving. Never write code until you know someone will pay for it.

But what if that approach kills something essential about why some of us create software in the first place?

I started programming at 10 years old, mesmerized by the magic of turning ideas into reality through code. Back then, I wasn't thinking about market opportunities or business models - I was creating because it felt amazing to create.

As I grew up and entered the professional world, I learned all the "right" ways to build products. Find pain points. Interview users. Validate hypotheses. Build MVPs only after confirmation.

But something never clicked about this process for me. Building without validation felt wrong according to business wisdom, yet somehow more natural to my creative process.

Then I realize - the disconnect wasn't about business strategy. It was about identity.

Some people are engineers who solve problems for money. Others are artists who express themselves through code and eventually make money.

When painters create, they don't start by validating if people will hang their work. Musicians don't survey audiences before composing. They create because they're driven by something internal - an artistic vision that demands expression.

The most interesting software often comes from this same place - creators following their intuition rather than market research. Think about it: would we have the original iPhone if Apple had only built what focus groups said they wanted?

The corporate world trains us to view programming as industrial production - software factories churning out business solutions. But for many of us, it's more like crafting digital sculptures where elegance, aesthetics, and personal expression matter just as much as function.

So next time you're sitting at your keyboard wondering whether to validate first, maybe ask yourself a different question: Are you a business engineer or an artist?






10. How many people become IPO millionaires?  I will not promote
Hi, I’m curious how many people actually have become IPO millionaires and how it has changed your life.

I did become an US IPO millionaire when a startup I worked for went public right before COVID. I was probably not even a first 1000th employee so I was completely surprised that my net worth grew exponentially overnight. I left after about two years at the company and exercised the options right after I left. IPO happened 2.5 years later. 

This was a job I had when I was 24-26 and became a millionaire before age of 30. I made enough to restructure my whole life and pursue what I want, but not enough to completely retire. However, if I continue to manage the proceeds well, I'll have more money than I could imagine from regular salary over time with compounding interest doing most of the work.

Haven’t been able to really talk to anyone about this experience IRL. Most of my friends who left the company pre-IPO did not exercise options because they couldn’t afford to or didn’t want to deal with AMT taxes.

Would love to hear your story and any thoughts on how common this is. Seems to be a true 1% story to make $1m+? 

*edited for additional personal context







11. When "differentiation" becomes disaster: Passes' catastrophic decision to allow underage creators (another Lucy Guo misfire) - I will not promote
**TL;DR:** Creator platform Passes (founded by Lucy Guo of Scale AI) is being sued for allegedly hosting CSAM after making the bewildering business decision to allow underage creators on their platform. They've now banned all minors, but the damage is done. A case study in how one terrible product decision can sink $65M in funding. Also, I will not promote.

Lucy Guo's second startup Passes was supposed to compete with OnlyFans by letting creators as young as 15 monetize their content (with "parental consent"). This seems like such an obviously terrible idea that I'm shocked it got through any level of VC due diligence.

Forbes published an investigation detailing how Passes is now facing a lawsuit for allegedly hosting and distributing explicit content of a 17-year-old. According to the actual lawsuit, Passes staff even removed protections meant for minors.

Sometimes there's a very good reason why competitors haven't done something - it's not an "untapped opportunity," it's a landmine they were smart enough to avoid. This case perfectly illustrates when "differentiation" is actually just a terrible idea that others recognize as such.

What's fascinating from a startup perspective is:

1. The platform hurriedly banned all underage users days before the lawsuit - an obvious admission they knew this was problematic
2. Guo admitted in (now deleted) tweets that their ML content filters weren't applied to talent managers due to "cost and trust" - a devastating admission
3. Despite this, they raised $65M from investors like Bond Capital and Menlo Ventures

For all the talk about content moderation being a solved problem with AI, this demonstrates how one fundamentally flawed product decision can't be fixed with technology. The lawsuit alleges Passes earned $47K from just one inappropriate conversation with a minor.

What other startup decisions have you seen that were so obviously flawed from the beginning? I can't believe this wasn't seen from 1 million miles away by investors.






12. What are the dumbest ways (new) founders kill their startups? (I will not promote)
Let's be fair, every founder makes mistakes. I'm curating a list, so I'm curious what you all think.

For me, the top mistakes that seem dumb in hindsight are:

1. Validating your idea with the wrong people - "I don't understand, all my friends on social media told me I'm a genius!"
2. Waiting too long to launch - "Perfection is the enemy of progress," and you'll never run out of features to add before you decide to get real feedback beyond the story in your head that you're a genius.
3. Hiring friends and giving them half your equity just because they're friends (edit: prematurely without vesting schedules or cliffs), or finding the first person that will work for free and making them a cofounder.
4. Vanity metrics - "We have thousands of followers on social! That's product-market fit!" Or a more subtle version is pretending that free users are a sign of product-market fit when nobody is actually buying.

I'm personally guilty of 3 out of the 4. It's frankly embarrassing to think back on those times. There are others like raising capital too early or being undisciplined with cash flow. But I'm sure they'll come up.

What would you add to the list?

Edit: Also feel free to share how you solved/avoided these as well.

13. This Simple Equity Mistake Has Killed More Startups Than Bad Ideas- i will not promote
Let me make it simple. (i wiill not promote)

You don’t build a company alone.

You might spark the idea. You might even carry it through the early chaos. But if you’re aiming to build something real, something great, you’re going to need others who believe in it as deeply as you do and who are willing to sacrifice just as much to make it happen.

That’s what a co-founder is.

Now let’s say you've been at it for six months. You've put in your own money. You’ve lost sleep. You’ve started shaping something from nothing.

Then someone walks in, not with a paycheck, but with belief. They’re ready to pour themselves into your vision, without guarantees. No salary. No safety net. Just shared risk, shared struggle.

So how much of your company do they get?

Things get tricky here:

It’s not about what’s fair for the past. It’s about what’s necessary for the future.

A lot of founders get trapped in a simple but dangerous mindset: “I started this, so I deserve most of it.” That might be emotionally true. But it’s strategically wrong.

Building a company takes ten years, maybe more. If you’ve done six months of work, then 95% of the real journey is still ahead of you. And success will be determined not by who started the race, but by who finishes it and how.

If you want someone to fight in the trenches with you, to think, build, sell, dream, and bleed with you, you’d better make sure they’re not a hired hand in spirit. You’d better make them a true partner.

Because that’s what they’ll need to be.

And investors know this too. If they see your co-founder holding a tiny slice of equity, they’ll smell the imbalance. They’ll know this person might walk away when things get hard or worse, they’ll stay half-hearted.

And that’s deadly.

So here’s the perspective I believe in:

Don’t protect your slice of the pie. Grow the damn pie.

Give enough equity that they feel like it’s their company too. Not just yours.

Sometimes that’s 50/50. Sometimes it’s 60/40. The exact number isn’t the point. What matters is whether you both feel equally responsible for the outcome. Equally committed. Equally empowered.

Because the company you’re building, if it’s worth anything at all, will be built together

15. playbook YC startups use to add $2M+ ARR in 3 months (I will not promote)
Here's a YC success case study of using hyper-specific micro-campaigns to drive a ton of B2B enterprise sales.

The core ideas:

1. Start with tiny lists (10-100 prospects). Instead of massive csvs with 10k+ prospects, use lists so specific the list *itself* basically writes the messaging. Think "Series A founders in X niche who recently hired Y role". Use tools like Clay for enrichment.

2. List = Messaging. Because the list criteria are so tight, the email angle should be super relevant right off the bat. Less generic BS, more "I saw you specifically did..."

3. Multi-Channel Punch: Uploaded the *same* micro-lists for LinkedIn connection requests (directly from founder profiles). Accepted connection => relevant, manual DM. Hit email + LinkedIn in the same short window.

4. Founder Content: Posted 4-5 valuable LinkedIn pieces weekly (wins, insights, even personal stuff). Keeps you top-of-mind and builds authority.

5. Engager Outbound: Scrape LinkedIn post likers/commenters, enriched, and run *another* targeted outbound sequence if they fit the ICP. (Basically, "Hey, saw you liked my post on X, thought you might find Y interesting...")

In summary, it's all about creating a wall of sound with high-quality, relevant touches, not just volume. More upfront work on list building and personalization, but way fewer crickets and way more actual meetings booked.

tldr; more targetting, less blasting.

16. Skip CTO hires. Fractional experts and quick hacks got us to market faster. I will not promote
I founded a SaaS startup, I will not promote and I learned quickly that launching lean beats scaling prematurely every single time.

Initially, we didn't hire a full time CTO. Instead, fractional experts and freelancers helped us quickly build an MVP, validate our hypotheses and gain early traction. We didn’t over engineer or obsess over building "perfectly scalable" infrastructure. Just quick hacks and genuine customer feedback.

Some key lessons learned firsthand:

First, startups don't always need permanent CTOs early on, fractional CTOs or freelancers can save both money and headaches.

Second, rapid validation is crucial. A quick and dirty prototype is better than months spent building the "ideal" product nobody asked for.

Third, hiring developers through your network vastly outperforms job listings. Personal recommendations made all the difference.

Fourth, co-founders should complement each other - ideally one tech-minded and one focused on business management. Solo founders can easily burn out.

Staying lean and pragmatic early on helped us reach product market fit faster. Now we’re growing steadily, without investors breathing down our necks and genuinely enjoy building the product.

Curious to hear from other founders how are you navigating tech decisions at your startups?






17. looking for a startup coach - I will not promote
Hey I'm looking for a startup coach!

I’m Maddie, solo founder/coder. I’ve built a few 6 figure companies and a few flops too :P
I'm 26, dropped out of Stanford because I just love building and doing my own thing. Def not a VC person.

I run a small AI B2B SaaS startup, have about 50 customers. My biggest struggle is my exec function. I can't decide what to do for the day and I have struggles sticking to plans. When overwhelm hits, I find it hard to do things. I find it really helpful to talk things out and have a plan to stick to, one we can adjust each week.

I’d love to work with someone who:

- Has experience helping solo founders build weekly systems and structure

- Can think strategically with me, hold me accountable, and help me stay grounded when I start spinning out

- Is open to texts/questions during the week, and can dive deeper during our calls

- Is pretty direct and chill, solid thinker

I'm also a go getter, I care a lot about what I build and go all in.
Just looking for a little more structure and support so i can keep doing it without burning out. I will not promote






18. CEO is stepping down from the startup(10 people working) i am working. Should i be worried ? I will not promote
I joined this company only a few months back. The company wasn't generating great revenue, and 6-7 people didn't get a salary for three to four months. Today I got a mail from the CEO that he is stepping down and transitioning out of the company. Also mentioned they raised funding, and the board wanted someone with scaling experience to take over. I think I am in a tough spot, or am I ? I have heard stories of layoffs in big companies but how things are gonna affect here ? Its a biomedical engineering company

  
I WILL NOT PROMOTE






19. I left home to find a startup idea. I found myself instead. (I will not promote)
I was 19 when I first started my startup while in college — a tech startup. I led a team of 15 people. It didn’t work out.

At 21, back in 2016, I left home with no money. I told myself I’d find “the idea” on the road and come back to start something that mattered. I even used to note down different ideas in my journal during that time.

But somewhere along the journey… the road started feeling like home.

For two years, I travelled without money. One year was on a moped. Along the way, I did whatever work I could find — sold toys on the road, sold myself as a writer, teacher, manager, artist, waiter, driver… whatever the day needed.

Then came the dream of living in a van.

I did everything to make that happen. Sold tea on the road. Ran an Airbnb. Learned video editing to crowdfund. Worked as a delivery guy. Told every stranger I met about this van dream. I even ran a food truck as a chef because I knew it would help me get closer to that van someday.

Eventually, I bought it. Built a home inside it with my own hands. It took me a year — a lot of sweat and tears.

I lived in it for three years.

Met incredible people. Hosted them. Cooked for them. Shared stories and silences. Fell in love with them — and with myself. Volunteered at the remotest of places.

When I sold the van, I thought maybe I’d start a hostel in Goa, India. That fell through — thanks to local politics and the tourism mafia.

So I circled back to tech. Tried building a startup again. Did everything I could. But it didn’t pick up.

That’s when I went back to the drawing board (by this, I mean my journal).

I sat with myself and realised who I actually am.

I love hosting. I love meeting people. I love listening to their stories, laughing with them, crying with them. That’s always been me, no matter what I tried to tell myself otherwise.

I’m a minimalist. There was a time I only had two black t-shirts, and I used to wear them on rotation. For two years, I wore only a dhoti — I had two of them and used to alternate between the two. I’ve even travelled without a phone — drawing maps in a notebook.

I’ve always been fascinated with sustainability, simplicity, and community.

So I started dreaming again.

This time: to buy a farm. Build a mud house. Grow my own food forest. Become self-sustainable. Live close to nature and in harmony with it. Keep working out and staying strong. Host strangers. Cook South Indian food for them. Maybe do something with food and fitness together.

And to fund that — I’m turning back to something that’s always supported me: writing.

I’ve been doing it for over 8 years. Ghostwritten an autobiography. A PhD thesis on abortion rights. Built and managed the personal brands of founders and leaders.

Writing has quietly funded my nomad life all these years, and if it supports this next chapter too, I’ll be grateful.

Hopefully, some opportunity comes my way, and I’ll be able to realise this dream this year.

I’m sharing this here as a reminder to anyone who might be feeling lost — we’ll all find our way.

Thanks for reading.







20. Has anyone ever "found a co-founder" that ended up having a *successful* startup? (I will not promote)
I went to a co-founder matching event last night.  

Met a lot of cool people but honestly it made me feel more like this is an impossible task.

I'm now 21... except with 27 years of experience (AKA I'm 48) and the older I get the more I value people I've known a long time.

I've had people I trust screw me over and people I met casually become very loyal to me.

I'm not sure anything can really help you find someone that you can trust except for *time*

I'd be willing to bet that the data around "startups that have 2 or more co-founders that are successful" might be tainted.

I'm wondering if they're interpreting the data wrong.

It seems that a co-founder that will eventually screw you over (either deliberately or accidentally) is actually a WEAKNESS not a strength.

The startups I've talked to, that have been successful, have been with co-founders that have known themselves a LONG time and already been in a fox hole together.

I'm starting to think I should just give up on finding a co-founder at this point and focus on product.






21. Launched v1.0 After 7 Years. Now I’m Burnt Out and Considering Selling - I will not promote
Last week, I finally launched version 1.0 of my public-facing service. It’s the result of seven years of grinding: learning to program from scratch, understanding the math, solving complex concepts, and figuring out how to work with clients.

Former colleagues have told me *“it looks GREAT.”* And I believe them.

But now… I’m exhausted.

For the past four months, I’ve been working 15–18 hours a day. My savings are gone. The launch is done, but the next chapter — actually running and growing the business — feels overwhelming right now.

My short-term plan is to find part-time local work (maybe at a deli) and try to focus on organic marketing. But there’s a thought that keeps crossing my mind — **maybe I should sell it.**

I never seriously considered that before. But after investing nearly a decade into building this thing, the idea of *also*operating it is starting to feel like too much.

Anyone else been here? Thoughts?

22. What’s the most ridiculous thing you did to keep your startup alive? (I will not promote)
I'm a huge fan of stories Founders tell about weird ways they've funded their companies.

I loved Brian Chesky's story (AirBnB) of selling cereal ("Obama O's" and "Captain McCains" during the election to raise cash (I think they sold like 30k boxes!).  I remember the (actual) Founder of Zappos (not Tony) talking about how his initial revenue came from photos of shoes at stores that he took and posted online to sell.

I always tell Founders it doesn't matter how you make your early revenue, just as long as you have some revenue.  So I enjoy seeing examples of how folks are doing it.

Curious—what's the weirdest, scrappiest, or most unexpected way you generated cash to fund your startup?

23. Made the jump from Big Tech to a startup: sharing 6 biggest mindset shifts I had to make [I will not promote]
\[I will not promote\] When I moved from Google to an early-stage startup, I thought I was ready. I had been in fast-paced environments before. But I quickly learned that the transition isn’t just about changing jobs: it’s a complete mindset shift.

The way you approach decision-making, user feedback, standards, and execution changes dramatically. And if you’re not ready for that shift, you can end up confused, misaligned, or just inefficient. → Ultimately, this will impact the startup and your ability to reach PMF. 

Whether you’re the founder or team members of that small startup, being hyper-aware of these changes will alleviate a lot of pain and help you focus on the important things : building, learning and selling.

I wanted to share 6 key mindset shifts anyone making the jump from Big Tech to early-stage must internalize:

# 1- Length of feedback cycle - feedback should happen fast

→ Rapidly iterate, distinguish between "perfect" and "good enough," and pivot based on user feedback.

# 2- Not all user feedback is created equal  

→ You're going to hear a lot of feedback and opinions. Some of it will be helpful. Most will be noise. Identify the signals most important to your goals and reprioritize accordingly. The real challenge is figuring out what not to act on, so you don’t burn out chasing every comment.

Example of a hierarchy of feedback quality:

Paying customer > paying POC > free POC > ICP-but-not-interested > friends & family

# 3- Urgency to ship impacts the speed and quantity of learnings

→ Adopt a “ship fast, learn fast” mentality, making you more comfortable with exposing imperfections to users in exchange for valuable feedback. Speed > polish.

# 4- There are no rules / standards, you have to set them

→ Nobody’s going to hand you a process doc, way of working doc, or code style guide. If you want high standards, you have to create and enforce them yourself. It’s exhausting. Failing to maintain the required standards will negatively impact all aspects of your startup: performance, quality and its ability to reach PMF.

# 5- Speed of decision making 

→ Startups don’t have the luxury of dragging things out. Become comfortable with making decisions based on incomplete data and realize that slow or no decisions can cost valuable time, money, and opportunities.

# 6- Less time needed on internal stakeholders, much more focus on users 

→ In Big Tech, you can spend a week making a deck for internal buy-in. Reallocate your bandwidth and priorities from “stakeholder management” to “user focus”. While alignment is important, it should be achieved in a non-bureaucratic way, allowing you to focus as many resources as possible on delivering value to users.



Obviously not an exhaustive list, every startup’s different. Curious to hear what mindset shifts others had to make!






24. I turned down money from a big company for my app. (I will not promote)
Earlier this year, I launched a small mobile app that started gaining organic traction in a category that I made. Out of nowhere, a mid-sized company in the field offered $50,000 to acquire it outright. No equity, no revenue share, just a buyout.

It was more money than I’d ever been offered for anything I’d built. But I said no.

I’ve been building solo projects for years, and this is the first one that felt like it had the it factor. I’m not even sure what it is. Maybe it's just the first time I’ve felt passionate about something. But walking away from that offer has had me questioning everything: am I being principled or did I make a mistake?

Would love to hear from folks here who’ve turned down buyout offers. How do you know when to cash out vs. go all in? What helped you decide?

Not naming the app, not fishing for feedback or users. Just trying to check my decision with others who’ve been here.

25. Sharing a slice of the grind today. I will not promote.
It was a day of pure, gritty customer outreach — referrals, cold calls, cold emails, cold DMs… whatever it took to find just one more champion.

Most of the day felt like shouting into the void. But then — out of nowhere — a sales rep connected me to the cofounder of a company I had been chasing.

His words: "Oh my god, you reached out to us — we were literally discussing this exact solution. Let’s talk tomorrow with my CEO."

That moment reminded me why I’m doing this.Building a startup solo is harder than I ever imagined — but moments like these make it impossible to picture living any other life.

26. The time I almost died with my cofounder trying to land that one big enterprise client (I will not promote)
TLDR: I learned the hard way that elephant hunting for your first enterprise customer is more often than not a waste of time. Start small and slow to eventually grow big fast. 

Full story:

I launched a SaaS. A very large company (billions in revenue) was interested and it would have been a massive first customer. They were 3 hours north of me so I drove up weekly to have meetings. (This was in 2015 before Zoom was a regular accepted thing.)

The prospect kept humming and hawing asking for more presentations and features. The internal “champion” enjoyed the power dynamics a little too much. 

One day driving back I hit a slick patch on the highway. The car spun 360 degrees into oncoming traffic. My only choice was to drive straight into the ditch and hit a wire fence. Totaled my truck. My cofounder hit his head and lost his hearing in that ear for a day or so. 

That was the last straw. I said “F these guys. Let’s get to the point where they need us more than we need them.”

Long story short I focused on smaller clients and accepted slower revenue growth. We never worked with them. But eventually I landed Fortune 500 users and after working with one of the most famous celebrities, we sold the company. It also allowed me to sell to the same level in my next companies. 

I see so many founders waste all their time trying to land that one big client out of the gate. That’s not to say it can’t happen and more power to you. But it’s a lesson I’ll never forget and I really loved that truck!

Win the quick revenue battles and you’ll win the war.

27. What services are worth paying for Fiverr, Upwork etc. „i will not promote“
I’m in the early stages of building my startup and juggling a lot of time-consuming tasks. Curious what services you think are actually worth outsourcing — especially when the cost is relatively low.

For example: would you pay someone to professionally redesign your Canva pitch deck?

Would love to hear what’s been worth it (or not) for you.






28. I want to be a great entrepreneur, but I’m just a normal 20 y/o student. How do I even begin?( I will not promote )
I will not promote 
Hey everyone,
I’m a 20-year-old student from a humble background. I don’t have a strong network, financial support, or any special talents. But I do have the will to work hard, learn fast, and do something meaningful—especially for my family. They’ve sacrificed a lot, and I want to give them a better life.

I’m deeply interested in starting something of my own—maybe a tech startup, maybe something small to begin with—but I’m still figuring it out. I read, I watch, I try to learn... but I still feel lost about how to actually start. What skills should I focus on? What mindset should I build? What are the small steps that eventually lead to something big?

If any of you were once like me—normal, unsure, but driven—how did you take your first steps?
Any guidance, personal experience, or resources would really mean a lot.

Thanks in advance.







29. Best Startup Companies you thought would NEVER Work - Here's Mine (I will not promote)
I have a very long history of being incredibly wrong about startup companies - which is why I'm not an investor ;)

What's the best idea you never saw coming?  Here are mine:

**Ring Doorbell** \- Jamie Siminoff (founder) was the co-founder of my last startup.  When he was launching "DoorBot," a device that texts you when someone rings the doorbell, I thought it was doomed.  Jamie is awesome, but I absolutely didn't see what he would turn into Ring. ($1b+ exit).

**eBay** \- I'm old enough to remember when eBay launched, and I thought, "This is the dumbest idea. Anyone can just take a picture of a Rolex and "claim" they have it.  This will last about 5 seconds.  It lasted longer.  ($31b Market Cap)

**Uber** \- The early launch was a black car service, which made sense to me, but when they pivoted to "some random person in a Prius will pick you up and (maybe) drop you off alive."  I was like "This will last about 9 seconds before someone's daughter never gets returned."  Maybe that's the 80s kid in me being warned about getting in a stranger's van.  ($152b Market Cap).

.. I mean, I can go on and on, but I've got to imagine some of you have a company that you absolutely thought would tank and is now wildly successful.  I think it also provides some encouragement for all Founders who are going up against those odds.

31. Investors say some of the most incredulous stuff (I will not promote)
Story time: I’m working with a founder to raise a series A. The VC asked to talk to customers. The founder lined up 2 fortune 100 companies that agreed to $100 million contracts ($10 million first payment). They got on the phone with the VC. 

VCs response after the meeting: “We think they’re your paid advisors.”

When the founder told me this I was dumbfounded. Not to mention this founder has had 6 exits including to unicorns. I was like, “Have the VCs heard of LinkedIn? Why would a major brand fake a reference like that?”

The founder and I then made a plan to personally deliver the press release of his future exit to that VC firm in the future. 

Look, I get it. Investors are people too. And so are founders. I’ve sat in both sides of the table and try to empathize with everyone. 

I tell investors all the time that their process is their product. It’s not just the money. And that includes how they speak to founders and treat them. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve worked with great investors and VC in my day. But I’ve also worked with individuals that I believe a special place in hell. And yes, that sounds harsh, but I have the receipts of what they’ve done to me and founders that illicit such a strong reaction. 

Great VCs don’t make you jump through useless hoops and string you along. They move quick and have personal calls to get to know you. And if it’s a pass, they tell you with dignity and don’t add a power dynamic that slams the door, burns the bridge, and puts their reputation at risk. 

And yes, it’s a two way street. Founders can get a bad reputation as well. But come on. 

YC always says, “believe the no, but not the why.” Therefore, I take what VC and any investor says with a big heaping pile of salt. 

But sometimes, what they do say is important feedback, even if their motivations aren’t above board. I try not to let my disdain prevent me from a learning opportunity. 

I’m sure a lot of you have heard incredulous things from investors. At the same time, what have you learned? 

Let’s commiserate and I will not promote!






32. Everyone says they have this problem, but no one wants the solution — what am I missing? I will not promote
I will not promote.

I'm currently building a solution to a problem I keep hearing about during my customer discovery interviews. Literally *every* person I talk to acknowledges the pain point — they even go into detail about how frustrating it is.

But when I bring up the idea of a solution or a potential partnership, the energy drops. None of them seem interested in buying, piloting, or even partnering to shape the solution further.

It’s confusing — if the problem is real and painful, why isn’t there more interest in solving it?

I’m wondering if I’m framing the solution wrong, or if this is just a common trap in the discovery process. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you push through it?

Would love any thoughts, frameworks, or real-life experiences you can share.

Edit: since a lot of you mention the mom test, yes I have read it and try to follow it...






33. Close to shutting it down, here are the mistakes I’ve made so far [I will not promote]
My partner and I have been working on an AI content marketing tool for the last six months or so, and having failed to get any meaningful traction, we’re close to cutting our losses. I’m disappointed but at peace with where we’re at. I’ve learned a ton in the process and thought I would share some mistakes I’ve made along the way. Hopefully these help others avoid the same pitfalls. 

**Envisioned a cool feature, not a complete business**

The core of our business was the idea that successful content marketing rests on building a cross-channel content schedule and that marketing scheduling is the sort of repetitive task that AI is perfectly suited to automate. I've spent countless hours of my professional life copying and pasting cards on Asana and Trello and thought, “wouldn’t it be awesome if an AI agent could do this for me!” I still think that's true, but I let my narrow product vision cloud my assessment of the competitive landscape and the challenges of building a project management tool from scratch. Eventually, I realized that an idea for a neat tool alone is essentially meaningless.

**Imagined my ICP without actually talking to them**

I assumed automated content marketing planning would be useful for dev founders, solopreneurs, and small business owners who lack marketing experience. What became obvious quickly is that most people in this position don't need another tool or to-do list. Moreover, most dev founders (especially SaaS founders) focus on sales and cold outreach, not social media and blogs.

**Established a C Corp way before I actually needed to**

As soon as we decided to build a prototype and on an equity split, I went through the whole process of incorporating. In retrospect, I should not have done this until we had market validation and assurance of actual revenue. As a double whammy because C Corps aren’t pass-through entities, it’s way more difficult to claim losses on my taxes. Lesson learned!  

**Let FOMO guide my decision-making**

With everyone and their cousin launching AI tools over the last year, I feared being overtaken by competition and rushed into building without enough market research. Tale as old as time, right?  My realization here is that if a product is going to go the distance, it's worth taking time to get right. Launching in January or June shouldn't matter if you're building something people actually want.

**Paid for fancy design services** 

I convinced myself we needed a super polished landing page, pro UX, and a slick logo to stand out. This led me to contract a design firm I’d worked with previously to build a whole "design system." They did great work, but this was putting the cart before the Figma horse. I should have been satisfied with a functional prototype and worried about polish after validation. I also paid for a fancy .com domain unnecessarily.

**Built for a 2023 audience in 2025**

The pace of innovation is moving super quickly and as a result, people’s expectations as to what it has to deliver has completely changed even just in the lifetime of this project. Our tool would blow the mind of someone usinga couple years ago, but now...not so much. To be specific, so many new companies promise full automation of different marketing channels including copy, images, editing, posting etc. Tools like ours that focus on planning and scheduling seem antiquated by comparison. 

**Spent way too much time trying to connect on Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn etc** 

I spent countless hours trying to connect with testers and users. While this effort yielded a few positive connections, social media gives you the illusion of doing real work while failing to solve root issues. 

**Didn’t fully understand what goes into b2b/saas marketing** 

I've been a CMO at successful companies with exits under my belt, but almost all my experience has been in B2C. I misunderstood how my skills would transfer to SaaS marketing, which relies heavily on cold outreach, networking ,and "thought leadership."  I learned quickly I don't have the appetite for that world.

\--------------------------------------

Anyway, those are just some of my missteps. As I said up top, I've learned a lot through this process, and perhaps most importantly, I've gained a lot of insight on my own motivations and strengths, and have a way clearer sense of what I want to do next.     
  
We're still going to keep the current site/platform active, and have introduced some changes to refocus based on all the above. So who knows, maybe the latest incarnation will find some genuine users (while I will not promote, I'm happy to send the link to anyone who's curious).   
  
 Thanks for reading my self-reflective vent!    
  







34. The #1 simple trick to double your YouTube views (you're missing this!) (I will not promote)
Before uploading your video, make sure you are using keywords in your title and your description. A little trick that can help you is going to ChatGPT to copy and paste your video script to get relevant keywords within the 500-character limit. Keep in mind you can also use the option of adding chapters to add more keywords and improve the viewing experience. 

Once you publish your video, write a comment with a call to action or question to improve your engagement in those crucial first 24 hours. You can also create a GIF related to your new video and share it on the community tab with a brief description and a link to the video. Make sure this goes out shortly after the video is uploaded. And for every long-form video, create multiple short-form clips for platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. In the captions and within your short-form videos, include a call to action to encourage viewers to watch the full-length video. 

If a video is underperforming, use A/B to test the thumbnail or title, but focus on testing one element at a time. You can also A/B test thumbnails for free directly in YouTube Studio, but keep in mind it offers less data.

35. Where a dev with startup mindset and entrepreneurial spirt could find co-founders? - I will not promote
I like startups, I don't like soloing.
I tried, I just know that tech is fundamental, but unfortunately not enough for any business to become viable. 
I was wondering if any of you know a proper place where tech and non tech people could find each other to join forces and build together. 







36. Is it realistic enough to aim for a Pre Seed funding as a first time startup founder? - [I will not promote]
Hi everyone! So i am a 20 y/o Dev working on a productivity SaaS startup leveraging the *obvious* AI/ML haha with My former neighbour, 
we are currently working on the MVP, everything is there for the startup to be good enough for VCs to not ask, ‘How is your product different from your competitors?’ , we were thinking to raise pre seed, but according to some people it is hard to get a pre seed funding until and unless you have some experience on startups or some other parameters that makes you/your startup qualified for pre seed, is this statement true tho? Well, even though this statement turns out to be true, we’ll give it a shot, if we are unable to raise pre seed then we might bootstrap the development, then approach the seed round.






37. Should I push to sell my startup? I will not promote
Hi,  
We're running a small SaaS generating $100K in ARR, with 90% margins. There are 3 co-founders. The CEO left a few months ago for personal reasons, but still holds equity and contributes a few hours per week (less and less). Currently we are two working on it full time. To give you a better idea, since last year we grew our revenues by 10%.

To me, we have two possibilities now:

1. Maintain the startup alive, meaning we each put in a few hours per month and we share the revenues by 3.
2. Sell it, say, for 4 or 5 times the net ARR (which would be $90K x 4 = $360K).

The other co-founders prefer not to sell, as they believe the revenues can keep growing and more. I think it will slowly decline.

Also I really don't want to put some hours per months, it's mentally annoying and will not allow me to focus on something else as much as I should. I could just sell my shares, but I don't have a lot of ownership (7%, not fair but it is as it is).

What would you do?

Hey guys!

Fellow start up builder in here. I'm more into Community Development, and so now we've transitioned from client work to creating a platform that connects super communities with brands. Am I the only one who feels stuck or always bombarded with blockers and obstacles?

39. What VCs actually look for in early-stage SaaS MVPs (from someone who’s helped get there) [I will not promote]
I’ve helped a few non-technical SaaS founders go from idea → MVP → pre-seed.

Here’s what surprised them (and honestly, what surprises a lot of first-time founders):  
  
Investors don’t fund clean UI. Or clever tech.  
They fund *momentum, proof, and clarity*. 

One of my close friend, has a decent amount raised just for his idea and he gives credit to the clarity he had about going 0-1 with the startup. \[industry - shopify extension for e-com stores\]

Here’s what we focused on in the MVP that helped raise:

**1. Sharp outcome, not shiny features**  
We built one clear user outcome into the MVP.  
Not a dashboard. Not onboarding flows. Just:  
  
“A user comes in with X pain and leaves with Y result.”

It was ugly—but it *worked*. And it showed investors the problem → solution instantly.  
Make a list of KPI's and achieve them, if product works well, think what will retain the users and build that.

**2. Learning + usage data baked in**  
We tracked just 3 things:

* % of users who reached the “aha” moment 
* How fast they got there 
* What they said afterward ( pls talk to your users)

One quote in the deck hit harder than any demo.

**3. Compliance-minded from day 1**   
No full SOC2 or anything wild.  
But we flagged how we’d handle data, privacy, and scale.  
This mattered *a lot* to VCs with B2B or regulated space experience.

**4. Founder story that made sense**  
We helped the founder clearly explain:

* What v1 taught
* What they’d do next
* Why *they* were the one to do it

Because again: they’re funding motion, not features.

**PS:** If you’re building something and plan to raise soon, happy to share what we’ve learned or riff on your scope. DMs open

40. How much equity to give a co-founder who joins 1 year in? - I will not promote
Hey guys, in the past year.... myself and another friend have invested $30K. I personally have also worked 10 hours a week for a year. All of this to make an MVP which has gotten validation from our niche. Not just validation but genuine excitement. 

How much equity should I give another co-founder who wants to join today (1 year in)? 

I want him to feel motivates but I also feel like if I give too much, it completely doesn't reward the risk I took to get to this point. - I will not promote 






41. Need to Vent about the Unrealistic Expectations of Non-Tech Founders (I will not promote)
After doing 3 rounds of calls with this guy and providing him with a quotation on the very first call, a quotation he was seemingly okay with considering he wanted to move further. After me making the wireframe for him, one he's very happy with. When asked to sign the contract, he got back to me and asked if I can slash the price down to a third of what I quoted :) 

And then I come on Reddit and see this guy looking to build a fully fledged application that would cost at least $30k (US Market) for $500. Really touched a nerve there 

Non-tech founders grossly underestimate the amount of work it takes to build something usable. Let alone launchable. They expect good work for pennies. And when they either don't find anyone or find people who are sh*t at the job, complain about the lack of talent. 

Developers aren't incompetent, it's not hard to get something developed, you're just finding the worst possible people to entrust that responsibility with. All because you refuse to acknowledge that designing and developing a whole product is hard work that takes skill and good skill is expensive. 

When they're not looking for cheap work, they're looking for free work. With 0 tangible skills or experience they bring to the table or money to spend on marketing or anything that is valuable at all, they expect techies to sign up as co-founders and put their actually valuable hours and their actually tangible skills into building something the non-tech founder has no capacity to sell anyway. 

The internet has made absolute bums feel like they can be the next Steve Jobs just because they have an "idea". News flash- my stoner friend Sam has about 13 world changing ideas per smoke session. 

Without the ability to execute, do biz dev and raise funding, you're not a founder worthy of partnering up with for ANY tech co-founder.

I already develop for a lower price (50-70% of US/European firms) as I'm based out of the UAE and can afford to do so. Also I understand that at the early stages, founders really do have a capital problem. And non-tech founders struggle specifically to get something built and launched. That was the specific problem I set out to solve. To help non-tech founders. But it seems low isn't low enough and most of them don't even realise the work that goes into it. 

Only a very few of them, usually the experienced entrepreneurs, actually acknowledge the effort that techies put in. The new-comers expect to build applications like Uber at a price you wouldn't even get a Uber ride for at peak hours. It's crazy!

PS: ight now, don't get me wrong, I love developing for founders and most of my client experiences happen to be good (thank God). I've got founders that are not just clients but friends now. Just had a rough couple of days and that damn reddit post was the straw that broke the camel's back lol. Needed to vent a little. Thanks guys!

42. Our start up has stagnated (I will not promote)
I’m currently working as a front-end developer for a medtech startup that specializes in building, designing, and optimizing websites (including SEO) for medical doctors. The founder is a practicing doctor, and we have a strong working relationship. However, as a young team, we’re still navigating the challenges of early-stage growth. Since the founder balances this venture alongside his medical career, his focus has primarily been on generating leads, while I’ve been responsible for building and maintaining the platform. It’s been nearly two years since we launched, but growth has plateaued — we typically acquire about one client per month, with three being a rare high point. Has anyone experienced this stagnation? And what is the best method to improve scalability? Anyone have experience with this? 






43. How to solve the cold start / chicken and egg problem - I will not promote
Building a kind of monetizable social media platform where creators can sell every kind of digital content, but running into the usual cold start problem: creators need an audience to join, and users want content before they sign up.

For those who’ve built in the creator or UGC space:

* How did you attract your first creators without demand?
* How specifically can I get the first creators on my platform?
* What non-scalable tactics actually worked?

Looking for real strategies that helped you get past the “empty room” phase.

45. Are there any successful tech entrepreneurs who did not attend top universities?- I Will Not Promote
When you look at tech billionaires, it seems like all of them attended ivy leagues and/or top universities around the world. Especially with the new startups where it seems like absolutely every founder graduated from an Ivy League or Stanford. Is there a correlation between university name and success in tech ?






46. Anyone here built (or joined) a Slack community for startups? Looking for tips. I will not promote.
Hey all – I work at a VC firm that has ~400 active portfolio companies, and we’re spinning up a private Slack community for Founders and CEOs. The goal is to create a space for collaboration, shared resources, real-time questions, and a general sense of founder-to-founder support. 

I’m looking to learn from anyone who has experience building or participating in similar communities:
-What made it great (or at least worth being active in)?
-What killed engagement?
-What are smart ways to organize channels (we invest across Software, Life Sciences, HardTech, and Consumer Products)?
-What are some underrated tips that helped it run smoothly over time?
-Bonus points if you’ve dealt with managing scale or vertical-specific convos in one space.

Would love to hear any wins, lessons learned, or even horror stories. Appreciate the wisdom!






47. Bombed accelerator interview :/ - I will not promote
I had an interview for an accelerator program today. It’s my first interview where I had to give a pitch for my business. I’m still new to the startup world so I’ve never done anything like this before. I rehearsed for days and perfected my pitch. When it was time to deliver I was nervous! I saw the timer and the flow of everything threw me off. I’m really sad about it and I feel like such a failure. Life has been extremely hard for me over the last few months and I’m so tired of taking L’s. I was so excited for this opportunity and I feel like I just tossed it out the window :(






48. You ever drive yourself nuts treating everything like a startup? (I will not promote)
I think this affects serial founders the most. You look at every problem (big, small, random) and think, “How can I turn this into a startup?”

I hear comedians do this with every life experience. They think “How can I turn this into a bit?” 

So your mind is filled with constant thoughts of MVPs and then you realize “What the heck am I doing?” And then you have the audacity to start experimenting? Even talking to others about the problem. 

Eventually your the CEO of six new ventures in your mind? Finally you have a place where all your ideas go to die and call it a venture studio. If you have a spouse they constantly roll their eyes. And sometimes the worst part if everyone around you encourages you and the is they’re all great ideas. Bahahah. 

I’m sure I’m not the only one. 






49. Closing Down Successful Business Due To No Longer Wishing To Be A Manager / Employer. (I will not promote)
Hello,

I’m at a crosssroads with my business. I’ve realised I do not believe I wish to manage people or legally be an employer anymore. I built a product, raised money, hired a team, now in 3000 retail doors. Highly profitable.

Too early to sell apparently 


I hired a general manager and various managers and one of them fired two people who have now filed a lawsuit about how much he was a bully to them. 

I’ve noted my biggest issues have not been sales, customers, product it’s been with the liability of hiring people and as we grow even the managers we hire there are a cascade of issues which occur.

Another manager also was accused of being too hard on staff. 

I’ve tried to hire the best managers and have company culture documents etc but I still run into issues based on how they behave. 

I believed you could hire good managers however unfortunately these legal demands still affect me. And I’m tired of owning a business and being liable to this. I can’t get it right. 

I’m just sick of the responsibility of being a business owner. I’m sick of being the figure head at the top when my managers do wrong. 

I actually enjoyed building a business but I’m now sick and tired of managing people, hiring managers to manage people and just the onslaught of managing staff.

Hiring managers doesn’t help as the majority owner I’m still the person the lawsuits affect. 

I think I’m going to close my business as I just don’t think I can deal with the people and employment aspect of entrepreneurship

50. What’s the best places to promote your startup? I will not promote 😂
I was trying to find a good subreddit to post this. Ironically, this is the place that seemed to fit best as I will not promote.

Fellow startup founders, what are your best marketing channels to promote your product?

I’ve gone through the common launch sites:
- Hackernews
- Betalist
- Product hunt
- TinyLaunch

Then posted to
Subreddits that allow self promotion:
- SideProject
- Webdev on Saturdays
- Macapps

And then
- Threads
- X
- Bluesky

What worked for me (highest to lowest number of converted users)?

By far the most:
Threads,
r/macapps
r/SideProject

Then some from
Betalist

What worked for you? Any critical ones I’ve missed?








51. My 10 day journey as a full time startup founder. I will not promote.
It’s been 10 days since I jumped into startup life full-time, and I’ve learned more than I ever expected. Some of my reflections:

As an engineer, I love talking about features. But customers only care about the problem you’re solving, not the bells and whistles.

Not everything lines up perfectly: what I planned to build, what I like to build, what customers are excited about, what investors want me to build, and what actually solves the customer’s problem. The trick is to let everything else go and focus on one question: Is this solving the customer’s most pressing need?

Building the product can be straightforward, especially with tools like Cursors. The real challenge is making sure you’re tackling the right problem.

Every tiny victory feels massive—whether it’s app approvals, free cloud credits, or discovering a faster coding trick. Yes, there are endless setbacks too, but they don’t overshadow the excitement.

There’s no clear boundary between work and personal time now, yet I feel more energized. I realized burnout often comes from doing the wrong thing, not from doing too much of something you love.

There’s a constant sense that every minute not spent on the startup is a missed opportunity. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions, but that’s part of the thrill.These 10 days are only the tip of the iceberg; I’m excited to see what comes next.

I am looking forward to my next phase. But I can't be more excited

52. I can't "Relax", so I Found a Better way to Disconnect from my Startup (I will not promote)
For years I couldn't figure out why it was so hard for me to go on vacation or take a break and "forget about my startup".  

I would try, but every time I did I wound up being even more anxious than when I started.  I'd get 2 days into a week-long vacation, and I'd be sitting by the pool trying to wind down, but all my brain could do was think about what I had to do with my startup.

So a couple of years ago, I tried something different - I looked for a challenge that I could obsess over that was WAY bigger than my startup - and that's when it finally clicked.

I'm an avid hobbyist carpenter, so I decided to design and build a new house entirely on my own.  I would learn everything from 3D modeling to create it to all of the trades necessary to build it.  I made this thing so overwhelming that I had no choice but to consume my brain.

(BTW you can learn literally anything on YouTube!)

Now, truth be told, I wasn't able to build every single aspect myself since there were certain things (like laying foundation or structural steel) the I wasn't looking to take chances with.  But I've designed every. single. aspect of this house in full 3D (Sketchup, Enscape, Vray) down to the size of the drawer slide in the basement bathroom.  I've built every kitchen cabinet, vanity, closet - you name it.  

But this isn't me talking about my carpentry skills; it's about talking about what it DID for me.  

It completely changed my focus.  Not in a way where it hurt my startup, but in a way it HELPED my startup (and me personally, which I think should count for something).

I needed something that could compete with those anxious thoughts at 2am where I would normally be trying to solve my startup problems that frankly never got solved at 2am.  Instead my mind was consumed by SOLVABLE problems like how to best join two parts of a cabinet.  I had no idea how badly my mind needed to work on things that had a definitive start and end (this isn't a small point, many of us having timelines that are years, decades).

I'm curious if anyone here has had a similar experience of how they've found a challenging counterbalance to their startup.  Yes, I'm also a father of two, so I'm well aware of how family fits here, I'm talking about outside of that.

53. Thoughts on CEO not practicing pitching - i will not promote
I will not promote. 

Ceo says they wont practice pitching yet has not closed a sale. Felt it was really disrespectful to say this in front of dev team and last few pitches i saw were somewhat dismal. Is this normal? I practice everything, even retrospectives to get them right.






54. Big deal with a large company fell through. How do you mitigate the “cost” of negotiations? I will not promote
Half vent, half a request for advice (I will not promote)! 

The last 6 months, we’ve been negotiating a large purchase agreement with one of our customers (large for us, not the customer!). Our proposed terms haven’t changed since the first meeting, but that didn’t stop things from moving slowly and going through the same “negotiation” again and again:

 

Customer: “Can you change X term of the deal?”

Us: “No, we’re not able to change X.”

Customer: “Ok. We still intend to move forward with the purchase.”

 

Repeat twice a month until two weeks ago when we get an e-mail from the customer saying:

“Wanted to let you know that management has approved this order. Will have a P.O. in two weeks”

 

One Week Later:

“Still on track for a P.O. next week. Can you confirm you and your vendors are reserving product in good faith that this will move forward?” 

 

One Week Later (today):

“The team is evaluating other solutions. We’ll let you know if we decide to go with you.”

 

We had some reasonably high legal fees associated with reviewing their contract language, we asked for favors from our suppliers to make sure we’d be able to meet production timelines (thankfully we didn’t pre-purchase anything!), I spent a lot of time lining up financing for the deal, and the whole team spent a lot of time and effort on the negotiation. I just feel like the company is a bit poorer and I’ve got some egg on my face. All that being said, I’m not sure what we could have done differently.

 

I doubt this will be the last time something like this happens. I’m curious how others approach these types of negotiations?






55. These 2 Fundraising "Hacks" Helped me meet 100s of Investors (I will not promote)
Most Founders know zero Investors.

I tell every Founder that will listen when it comes to Fundraising that there are 2 "hacks" that helped me more than anything when I was trying to raise VC for my last 3 companies.

*Quick Backstory - I moved to LA and didn't know a single investor. So I built a system to strategically get connected and then grew it very quickly to hundreds of investors I met in person.*

**Hack 1 - Start with Funded Founders**

We all want those vaunted "warm connections" to investors, but no one really knows how to get enough of them to matter.  The answer is simple - talk to funded Founders, even if you don't know them yet.  Especially those that have investors that you'd like to have as well (Crunchbase has most of this info btw)

Two reasons for this -

1. Founders are amazingly cool, and we love to help each other, so we're way more open to helping strangers who happen to be Founders.  So go talk to some strangers (Founders).
2. Founders can tell you exactly who NOT to talk to, and why, because they just went through this whole gauntlet.  But if they like you, they will often be willing to make a warm intro to their investors.

*My experience* \- I didn't know a single person, so I cold emailed Jason Nazar (had just started DocStoc at the time, sold it later) and said "Hey I don't know you, you don't know me, but we're both Founders, can we get a coffee and talk shop?"  It turned out Jason had just taken a bunch of capital (I didn't even know this) and immediately made introductions to a bunch of investors who ended up funding my deal.  He's a goddamn Startup National Treasure btw ;)  But all it took was one person to get the ball rolling.

**Hack 2 - Every Investor is a Node for more Investors**

Every investor is a potential node to LOTS of other investors *regardless of whether or not they invest.*  Your mileage may vary, but I found most investors were willing to point me toward other investors they knew because that's how they operate.  It's part chivalry and part ego (in a good way) where they want to show that they can help.

Ask every single investor, unless the meeting just went horrifically wrong, whether they would recommend any other investors to talk to, and if so, if they would be open to an introduction.  BTW if they say no, I can almost guarantee they aren't interested in investing!  But you're going to get a lot more "Yes" folks I'd suspect than you imagine, and most people don't even think to ask.

My experience - I started out with just a few investors who were local to LA at the time, but they each introduced me to 1 or 2 of their friends, and I was adamant about asking for more connections (I was cool about it, but I always asked) and they consistently obliged.  In the end I got first hand introductions to hundreds of investors (most of Sand Hill Road) simply by networking through those nodes, in a very short period of time.

... I hope this helps a few of you, but I'd also like to hear if any of you have a similar strategy that's worked well for you that I can share with my fellow Founders.

**Does anyone else have any hacks that I can share?**

56. An investor wires you $1 million and says “go build a sustainable and profitable company,” what’s the first thing you spend it on? (I will not promote)
Let’s make it interesting. Your salary is taken care of plus your bills.

Founders work super hard on raising capital, sometimes not even really sure what happens next other than “I’m just happy I won’t be living on the streets.”

So what do you do?

Edit: It's interesting how a lot of the initial answers have to do with other startups or business ideas versus how you'd spend it in your startup.

58. How I Generate Revenue before a Product is Built (I will not promote)
Maybe I'm old fashioned, but to me startups are supposed to be about making money, not products.  The products are a conduit to make money, the money isn't a conduit to build products.

So when I start a company, the first thing I think about is "How do I make money immediately, BEFORE the product is ready."

I wish more Founders thought like this, because it's a total game changer.  We somehow think that if the money we make isn't directly coming from the product that we build that we're doing something wrong.

It. doesn't. matter.

Here's the 3-step thought process I use:

**Step 1 - Sell the Idea, build little to nothing.**  Whether it's slapping up a landing page or launching a crowdfunding campaign, all I care about in the initial stages are trying to generate pre-orders for the product, OR, in some cases, making the web site effectively an order taking app for a process I'll do manually.

When I started Unsubscribe with Jamie Siminoff (Founder of Ring Doorbell) we put up a Web site that allowed anyone to download our button (circa 2009) to unsubscribe from emails. Zero tech. We had a team of interns finding unsubscribe links and clicking them for you, but it proved demand, and we scaled an sold to TrustedID (they since buried it, but that's a different story)

**Step 2 - Sell Services around the Idea.**  This is my favorite.  I think every product company should (try) to be a services business first, because services make money immediately and it gets us in the habit of actually delivering the product.

When we launched Fundable, (Crowdfunding for Startups, circa 2012) no one had any collateral to build a profilt (pitch deck, site assets) so we started a services company to help people develop that.  The services company hit seven figures in the first year and became more valuable than the platform.  Everyone else was raising capital - we didn't need any.

**Step 3 - Whatever it takes, just earn money.**  It actually doesn't matter if what you're earning money for has anything to do with the business, so long as it keeps cash coming in the door long enough to survive.  I hear a lot of "But that challenges our focus!"  You know what challenges your focus?  Running out of money.

My favorite story there is from Brian Chesky from AirBnB.  Back when he was trying to keep the lights on in the early days, he saw an opportunity to sell merch at the Demo/Republican National Conventions. He sold $30,000 of "Obama O's" and "Captain McCains".  Baller move.  He also said he ended up eating the leftover boxes for a year after that.  That's AirBnB.

Ok this post is long - point is - Whatever it takes, just make some money.

Would love to hear stories from the community on how they made some early $$$

59. I will not Promote. Getting users is hard.. getting initial users is harder
I will not Promote.   
It's hard to get users.. extremely hard to get users. It's much harder to get feedback from early users because you wont' get them. Post on Reddit, Post on Twitter, Post on LinkedIn, everywhere people will tell go to place where real users are...

Now I fail to understand this, if on Reddit real users are not there, if no twitter real users are not there, if on linkedin real users are not there.. then where are they? No one tells there your users are, there you should go..

Building products is difficult, and marketing your product is extremely difficult. Is there any real ABC of doing things, does anyone know or everyone has to figure it out by themselves...

It's 1 year and 5 months, I am struggling to get real feedback.. and more struggling to find users.. have all users gone to Mars with Eon Musk?

Guys I am looking for real solution, even looking for users who can take care of marketing, I have a solid LIVE product and it's going nowhere .. because there is hardly any visitors..






60. Are we in an "Investor Recession" (and why?) (I will not promote)
I've been helping startups get funding for a couple of decades, as well as funding my own startups, so I've spent a lot of time in different fundraising environments.

This one somehow feels the worst - and I'm going back to the early 1990's as a time frame.

Here's what I \*think\* is happening based on my purview -

1. There's a ton less early stage investing happening.  I just don't see the frenzy anymore.  
2. VC's are coming off a horrible run on IPOs, and that's killing the "greed" element of investing.  
3. S&P 500 has been doing relatively well, so smaller investors can make good money in liquid stocks  
4. Interest rates have gone crazy, preventing a lot of what drives fund investing, etc.  
5. AI was supposed to be the "boom", but the investment largely concentrated on really big players.

... I think at some point all of this capital, especially from funds, has got to get deployed.

What are you seeing?

61. 7 days a week position I will not promote
I was invited to applied for a job as a python developer and they said the position consisted of working 7 days a week. Who in his right mind would do this? They said they have almost 20 people in the team. This is for a normal position, not a founder.

The burn out after working 7 days nonstop, this people will change employees like socks. Is the market that bad right now? This is incredible 






62. Where can a tech guy learn sales hands-on? (I will not promote)
I saw another question with a guy looking for Video courses and books about sales training.

The thing is, to me, books and courses are not the same thing as sales training as reading about piano isn't the same as playing and learning to play piano.

Someone in my opinion gave almost the best advice there saying "Pick up the phone and start calling".

Myself, I wouldn't really know where to begin with that. 

I'm looking for a structured training but I need more of a push and immediate feedback on what I did right, wrong, etc. 

How do you get this sort of sales training that gives you real hands on experience? I wasn't born with a family who pushed me to do door to door sales etc. 

I'm happy to go door to door but would like to at least know what the hell I did right or wrong when selling things.

To me, to quote The Wolf of Wallstreet, sales feels like "fugazi" and I'd prefer it to feel like, I don't know, linear programming concepts or something tangible.

63. Don’t Obsess Over the Competition. Obsess Over the Customer. i will not promote
Let me tell you something most founders get wrong. i will not promote

They worry too much about their competition.They check their Twitter. Set Google alerts on the founders. Read every press release like it's gospel. And you know what that does? It messes with your head. It pulls your focus away from where it should be i.e. on the customer. 

Yes, you should be aware of the world around you. But you don’t need to live in someone else’s orbit. You’re building your vision. Don’t let their noise become your narrative. 

Here’s what actually matters: 

High-Level Moves: If a competitor does something that shows up in the industry headlines — big funding round, massive feature launch, a major pivot — that’s worth your attention. Not because you need to copy them, but because it tells you something about the market. It’s data. Decode it. Let it inform your intuition. Then move forward on your own terms. 

Losing Deals: If you're losing customers to a competitor, dig deep. Why? Is it pricing? A missing feature? Security credentials? Then decide. Do we address it? Or do we reposition ourselves in a smarter way? This isn’t about reaction. It’s about adaptation.

Now, here’s what you can ignore: 

Their Polished Image: Just because they look good on the outside doesn’t mean they’re solid on the inside. You’re seeing a highlight reel. Not the reality. I’ve seen companies raise millions and still flounder. Wrong pricing. Wrong story. Wrong execution. Don’t assume because they act, it’s the right move. Think different.  

Their Funding:

 Money doesn’t equal mastery. It means they sold a story to an investor. Half the time, they burn through it in a year and a half. The money vanishes — and so does the company. If they raise big — five million or more — they might try to undercut the market. That’s not a death sentence. That’s a challenge. And challenges are fuel.

Being Copied: If people start copying you, it means you’re doing something right. Yes, it’s frustrating. But take it as a compliment. The best way to fight it? Keep innovating. Stay two steps ahead. Build a moat they can’t cross. Anyone can copy a feature. But no one can copy your soul.

You weren’t born to follow the market. You were born to change it. So here’s the truth. Don’t compete. Create. Keep your eyes on the dream. Build something beautiful. Let the imitators chase your shadow.






64. How I built an almost 200 waitlist without spending a dime, I will not promote
 \[I will not promote\] After failing dismally at my first startup with a team and cofounders, I decided to run solo. I felt it was important to get my s\*\*t together before involving other people. I also wanted to keep costs at a bare minimum. For my last venture, I was only active on LinkedIn and didn't join any communities, big mistake. 

This time I joined Reddit and X. Sure, some posts make me raise my eyebrows but mostly it's been a great space to learn. I've been applying the lessons I'm learning here seriously and applied them to my latest app, DataHokage

1. I built a waitlist using Waitlister. me ( not affiliated with this product, came across a post about it and decided to try it, best decision I've ever made). I didn't build a landing page or buy a domain. I wasn't going to spend money on something that might fail. The waitlist was all I had. I didn't even make it look decent. It's bare as hell.
2. Started posting and commenting on X, I spent 30 mins on X Mon-Fri. I only post on Reddit on Thursdays and/or Fridays but comment most days. I knew if I wanted to be successful I had to be consistent so I came up with a realistic schedule.

As you can see, I didn't do anything crazy to get those numbers. I would just encourage whoever is reading this to keep showing up. When I first started on X it was like I didn't exist now I'm getting a minimum 5 new followers Mon-Fri.






65. Has Anyone *Legitimately* had an idea "Stolen" by an Investor? (I will not promote)
In 30+ years of being a startup Founder and working with thousands of other Founders, **I have never seen or heard of a single instance of an idea being "stolen" by investors.**

Yet it remains one of the most concerning issues first time Founders have when sharing their pitch deck.

Invariably they will say *"I need investors to sign an NDA!"* 

Which works never.  Also, if you're not sure, please don't ever ask investors to sign a Non Disclosure Agreement - they won't, and they shouldn't.

But back to the point - I feel like I've seen an awful lot in my Founder career, but "investors stealing ideas" has never come across my desk even once in that time.  

Has someone legitimately had this happen?  I would love to hear how/why so I can at least tell Founders "You know, there was this one story..."

66. Best law firm to contact to sue startups for unpaid wages/imvoices? (I will not promote)
Hi there! I worked at a startup as a 1099 worker and they stopped responding to me while we were discussing collecting payment. 1) How do I go about this?
2) any law firms you can recommend me to sue the company? I have about ~$40k in unpaid wages for my work. Thanks!

67. What is your idea of Startup Hell?  -- I will not promote
There been some really interesting posts this week from people working through their startups asking questions, and offering advice. Sooooooooo while walking my dog a few minutes ago, the following question popped into my head.

**What is your idea of Startup Hell?**

What do you hate most about startups, or what did you hate about startups but now you're OK with it because you work through it eventually?

68. SaaS at $1k MRR, good metrics, no passion. What would you do? (i will not promote)
I built a SaaS that’s now doing $1k MRR and growing well. It started as a fun side project to try a new tech stack, no commercial intent. But now it’s become real, and I genuinely believe it can hit $5–10k MRR within a year. Users love it, LTV/CAC is solid, and my small distribution efforts are working.

The problem? I don’t care about the niche, and I’m not enjoying the work anymore. I’m a tech guy, I want to build deep, technical stuff. Instead, I’m spending my days emailing influencers and doing marketing. Every day feels like I’m slowly selling my soul.

Tried listing it for sale (Flippa, acquisition, etc.), but it got rejected for NSFW content. Not sure what to do — suck it up and scale it to $10k MRR, or go all-in trying to sell it now?

Anyone else been in this weird spot where the business is working, but your heart just isn’t in it? 

(I will not promote)






69. I Need to promote! (I will not promote)
Hey all! I know this is probably the most basic question ever asked here but... I have no idea how to promote.

I built an app and I'd like to get some first beta users. I don't know where to get them from.

I was thinking reddit, since many subreddit would have the perfect user base for it, but no one seem to allow self promotion.

Where should I get started? Need guidance.






70. Hiring salespeople at an early-stage startup - how are you doing it? (I will not promote)
I will not promote. Below is both a rant and a plead for help.. bear with me.

I used to be an AE at a FTSE 500 SaaS org (structured onboarding, clear ICP, some inbound, some predictable process) - not “President’s Club” but held my own.

Left a couple years ago to build something with two close friends (CTO + COO). We’re 15 people now (mostly contractors), remote-first, selling into sales ops teams at mid/large UK/EU companies. 

No VC backing. No GTM engine. It’s just us. I do all the outbound, deals, renewals, everything. I hate spray-and-pray outreach, so it’s slow but deliberate. But we’ve hit a wall. I need help with the GTM.

And that’s where I’m getting wrecked.

We’ve hired a few senior AEs. Strong resumes. Big names. Polished interviews. But once onboarded they struggled to ramp and needed more of the typical structure (scripts, inbound etc). Longstory short, it didn’t work. I don’t even blame them. I blame myself for picking the wrong ones.

The only one who stuck (and is crushing it) is a 24-year-old italian guy referred by someone I used to work with. No degree. No name-brand experience (in fact, very little experience at all). But my ex-colleague praised him so much that I gave him a shot.

He’s now outperforming everyone. Built his own pipeline. Showed me product angles I hadn’t thought of. Literally teaching me things. Yet, the referral-way is only thing that’s worked but it can't scale.

We’ve posted jobs (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc). 100s of applicants. Most aren’t even remotely relevant. Like, “Berlin-based psychologist applying to AE role” levels of off. I cant afford to spend 5 hours p/week just on reviewing resumes...

Funny thing is that I used to work in recruitment before SaaS, so I know a thing or two about hiring, but the "system" now feels more broken than ever.

We’ve tried building internal workflows to fix this. No idea if any of it will work.

So I’m here asking Reddit:

If you’re an early-stage founder without in-house HR/recruiting—how are you hiring salespeople who can sell in ambiguity? How do you recognise the "ability to move without a clear path" type of mindset? I find it odd I, an ex recruiter, is asking for advice but Im genuinely stomped.

I don’t have mentors in this space. I’d kill for a few actual stories from people in the same boat.

(P.S. Please don’t DM me your product. I’m genuinely not here for that.)






71. Non-technical cofounders: how did you find your technical cofounder and how did you compensate them. I will not promote
Needing a technical co-founder to help launch a P2P platform wondering how people found theirs. Currently in the early stages. (So no money yet) I’m able to make most of the website myself so it’s not necessarily at the moment. I’m just curious to hear people’s stories on how they found their cofounder/s
I will not promote 






72. Whats your start up horror story? (I will not promote)
Everyone has one. Once i demoed with a drunk CEO for our biggest client and he couldnt log in to the product and started yelling at me in the meeting. Once a dev died mid delivery and he was working on equity and the founders only paid for his daughters college. Didnt give his wife his shares. Even when it sold. 

 All downhill from there. (I will not promote.) 






73. Did anyone here partially quit their startup, got back to the job and continued with the startup on the side ? Does that work ? I will not promote.
I will not promote. Basically the title.

I quit my job last year from big tech to go full time on the startup. No salary since last 1 year.

We have built our product, and are now planning to sell it. Based on multiple discussions, and realizations, we concluded that the market we are selling to is not really huge. So there is limited potential in what we are building and selling.

I am thinking to come back to the job (possibly at big tech) and continue the startup on the side (trying to sell). I am basically frustrated with my routine and 0 salary. Also, this does not seem something which I want to bet my life or next 10 years on.

At the same time, there is some potential business (think around 1-2M ARR) based on what we are building and have built till now. I am planning to apply to jobs, get back to something full time and continue selling this on the side.

  
Did anyone do this before? Does it work?






74. How to market my startup | I will not promote
Hey all,  
Recently, I created an app for personal finance. I'm looking into Reddit to market/promote my app on Reddit. How to do this? There are a lot of Reddit communities, including this one are not meant to self promote (except a few exceptions), which I understand. I want to do this in the right way.






75. Does having a woman cofounder make a team open for women supported startup events, fundraisers, VCs etc.? “I will not promote”
I’m genuinely curious. “I will not promote”.

I’m not trying to pull in a woman cofounder for the sake of opening up more avenues for a startup and also that’s not the right way to find a cofounder as well.

This question came to my mind randomly. 

If there is one male founder and one female cofounder, does it make the team eligible for women funded startups, events, etc.?








76. Best Way to Hire a Full-Stack Developer in Europe? „i will not promote“
Hey! I’m a Europe-based (Germany to be precise) founder with a tech background. I built a full Swift MVP of my app — now I’m looking for a talented full-stack dev (or small team) to turn it into a scalable product.

Where would you look for high-quality devs at a fair price in Europe? Freelancers, agencies, platforms — any tips or lessons learned are super appreciated!

Thanks!






77. PhD founder - I will not promote
Hi all, I'm doing a phd at Johns Hopkins and did my BA at Berkeley. I am looking into founding a startup at this moment and plan to pursue it in parallel with my studies. 

I wanted to ask: does doing a PhD while you're a founder look bad to investors? How is this generally seen? What are some tips and strategies i can employ? And no the startup is not related to my research; no IP worries.

79. First time founder, how far did you go for your first sales? | I will not promote
Selling as a startup feels like looking for your first job as a graduate. People are not willing to buy from you because you’re to young/unexperienced but nobody wants to give you a chance to become experienced. How did you get your first sales? What did you do besides cold calling/mailing?






80. Who said running a business was fun? (i will not promote)
I have a SaaS that's doing $1k MRR and additional sold two licenses for commercial use of the open source codebase for $5k. The product was a B2C freemium and had elements of NSFW and attracted weirdos and I had to do so much moderation and it was just soul crushing.

So eventually I couldn't take it anymore and quickly started talks with buyers for 2-3x ARR, but literally just a few days after starting talks with buyers, Stripe banned my account so now I am completely fucked.

I'm on an email chain begging stripe to reverse the ban, asking what I can do from a moderation point of view and reaching out to everyone I know to try and reverse it, but I don't even know anymore.

I feel like calling it quits and just moving on. This whole experience has been just extremely painful and quite traumatic tbh. I don't know how much more I can take of this 

(i will not promote) 






81. Founders who aren’t in a major city, what are you working on? [I will not promote]
I’m a founder in SF. Like most of us, I’m not from here, and I don’t particularly like being here. Not for political reasons, I’m just not one for city life. 

My only justification for staying here is that it’s the best place to be as a founder. I’ve heard this from other founders as well. 

I’ve also heard of people who are building from small towns, 2nd/3rd tier cities, and even from a boat. If this is you, what are you working on?

I will not promote!






82. Is now the time for a European social media startup? I will not promote
With U.S. platforms dominating and tensions rising, is there room for a social media app built and based in Europe?

Full control over data, policy, and direction — no dependency on U.S. companies.

Real opportunity or just a fantasy against the network effect? I will not promote






83. anyone here have real experience with influencer marketing? - I will not promote
I will not promote any product or service - just genuinely curious how it’s worked for others.

I recently ran a tiny test:

Reached out to 12 micro-influencers on Instagram (5k–15k followers)

Sent them free samples of my product (low-cost, handmade stuff)

Got 3 to post

And… crickets.

Barely any clicks, no sales, and one person even ghosted after receiving the sample.

I’m not bitter - just confused.

Is this a volume game? Did I pick the wrong people? Or maybe my product isn’t “shareable” enough?

Would love to hear if anyone's had actual success with this.

What worked? What flopped?

And how do you even measure ROI in this space?

Not looking for agency pitches or anything like that - again, I will not promote.

Just want to learn from anyone who’s been in the trenches.

Let me know if you’ve got a story - good or bad. I’m all ears.






84. Fuck it, you should crowdfund. I will not promote

Well fuck, now we are closing and could have used that cash. Should have just don’t the community round.

85. What skill do you wish you'd developed before starting your startup? I will not promote
Which skill do you wish you had before starting up? Is it about technical skills such as developing, software, etc; or is it more about softskills like communication, leadership, time management, etc? 
Are you developing that skill
at the moment? What benefit could having that skill give you?






86. is freemium a waste of time when you're starting out? i will not promote
We tried it all with our startup and having a freemium offering is a blessing and curse

**The spectrum:**

Freemium (limited functionality) - paywall your most valuable features you can expect to convert 2-6% of users to paid customers

Freemium (limited time period) - allow for a 14day free trial, either taking payment card details or not - in our experience it didn't really make a difference, there's so many people using cards with zero balance and so your MRR projection will not be accurate if counting on free -> paid trials

Hard paywalls - requiring upfront payment, you could soften these by offering a time-based money back guarantee (which we have now)

**Our Review of Freemium:**

* More user feedback: A larger user base provides more data points about product usage
* Feature popularity: Easier to see which features users engage with most
* Broader market testing: Allows testing product-market fit across different segments

However, there's a rarely discussed downside: the quality of that feedback. Users who aren't paying often have different needs and expectations than those willing to pay, which can lead to building features that free users care about but paying customers don't value

**Our Review of a Hard Paywall**

* Immediate validation: People voting with their wallets provides stronger validation on your startup and idea
* Higher-quality feedback: Paying customers often provide more detailed, actionable feedback and are more willing to hop onto calls
* Development focus: naturally you are building what actual paying users want
* Lower support costs: Fewer users requiring support

The tradeoff is potentially slower growth and less market exploration.

**Freemium Success and Failure Stories**

**Freemium Success**: Dropbox and Spotify prove freemium can work spectacularly. Dropbox grew through referrals and network effects, while Spotify created a clear distinction between free (ads, limited features) and premium.

**Freemium Struggles:** Evernote initially thrived with freemium but struggled to convert enough users to sustain growth. The free product was too good, reducing the incentive to upgrade.

**Questions to Determine Your Approach:**

* How crowded is your market? Crowded markets may require freemium to gain initial traction
* How proven is your solution? Novel solutions often benefit from freemium to prove value
* What's your primary constraint? If data/feedback is your constraint: Consider freemium
* What's your cash runway? Shorter runway may necessitate faster revenue (paywall)
* What are your costs to service a customer? If you're building an AI product each free user will likely cost you tokens

What's been your experience with these models?

87. Is your startup using AI? How do you handle AI model costs? I will not promote
Hey everyone,   
I’m curious about your experiences. There are tons of AI-focused startups popping up right now, and I run one myself. I’ve found that figuring out cost optimization can be really tricky, and it has a huge impact on how we set prices and plan our business model.

Have you had any good or bad experiences with these challenges? Any interesting stories about how you’ve managed to reduce your reliance on external providers or lower your AI costs? I’d love to hear your tips and insights!  
  
I will not promote






88. I will not promote
I want to be involved in this community so I thought I’d just tell you all that I will not promote. I’ve worked in many startups and never thought about promoting until I saw all the people saying they will not promote. Then I really wanted to promote. But I’ve composed myself enough to admit that I will not promote.






89. What’s your process for validating startup ideas before building? Trying to improve mine and wondering how others handle it. i will not promote
I will not promote. I’ve been obsessing over early-stage validation lately—especially how much time solo founders (myself included) can waste building before realizing no one actually wants the product.

In my case, I’m trying to systematize the validation process. Instead of going full MVP or shipping a full product, I’ve been playing with workflows like:

* Writing down 5+ variations of the same idea to stress-test the core
* Creating quick landing pages + simple survey funnels
* Running ultra-targeted Reddit/Twitter/Google Ads with $25–50
* Measuring CTR + actual form fills as early traction signals

It’s helping me dodge the trap of building beautiful things for ghosts, but I still feel like I’m winging parts of it.

So I’m curious:

**How do YOU validate an idea before committing to build?**  
Do you talk to people first? Fake-door test? Do you treat pre-traffic like a dealbreaker?

Bonus question: If you’re not technical, how do you get something live *fast* without relying on a dev cofounder?

Would love to hear what systems or red flags you've developed over time. If enough people are interested, maybe we can put together a Notion doc of everyone’s idea validation stack/process. I’ll start.






90. Got fired from a YC-backed startup and built a no-code tool in a highly competitive market (not AI) [I will not promote]
Hi r/startups, 

My name is Bohdan, and I will not promote.

After 2 years as the first employee at a YC-backed startup, I found myself suddenly free to build something I'd been thinking about for a while. During my time there, we struggled surprisingly hard to find a modern, reliable form builder that met our needs.

So, after leaving, I've decided to spend the next 5 months building a tool in a highly saturated, competitive, and boring market.

One big advantage of this is that I didn't have to validate the idea, as there are tons of solutions on the market already, so clearly there is demand.

On the other hand, I'm now noticing how hard it is to compete, especially when your tool is nowhere near its competition, with many features missing.

I'm now experimenting with different marketing channels (seo, social, paid ads, cold outreach), while also working on adding missing features to the product. There is consistent traffic with about 10 daily signups, which I'm quite happy about, but it's mainly coming from paid channels, that's not sustainable long term, especially for a freemium product.

I'd be grateful for any feedback or inspiring stories on how you found your first users.

Thanks!






91. I’m a PM who just got prod access AMA (i will not promote)
It’s in the title folks. For the first time in my career I have been given prod access. I believe that makes me the first product manager ever with access to prod. Everything I do from now on will change the course of history. History has its eyes on me. 






92. What’s working for you in getting your first 50-100 B2B customers? I Will Not Promote
We launched an AI tool for finance teams and are now trying to land our first batch of users. Cold email seems to be the most viable option since paid ads haven’t really converted. Problem is, building a lead list takes forever and we don’t have budget for tools like ZoomInfo. Would love to hear from other early-stage folks—what’s worked for you when getting those first crucial customers? I will Not Promote






93. Cold emailing for early users? Here’s what I wish I knew first | I will not promote
Like a lot of early-stage founders, I assumed cold email would be a great way to get our first users. We run a SaaS that helps local businesses manage their online presence, so I figured: buy a list, send some emails, and boom—customers.  
Nope. Most emails bounced, some responses were downright hostile, and I learned the hard way that sending to bad addresses can hurt your domain reputation fast. We had to clean up our list and rethink our whole approach before we could even get emails into real inboxes.  
Cold outreach is trickier than I expected—deliverability, targeting, messaging, all of it. What’s something you wish you knew before sending your first cold email?

94. Built out of pure recruiter-related rage. Trying to validate if this is just me. (I will not promote)
I’m building something out of sheer frustration. Not trying to pitch, just want to sanity check if anyone else has hit this wall.

Every time I look for a dev contract, I get hit up by 20–30 recruiters in the space of a month. Some are sound. Most are chaos.

I’ve had:

* Recruiters pitch me the same job under three different agency names
* Ones that ghost after multiple interviews
* Others who act like I’ve never spoken to them before
* And my favourite: “You’re a brilliant fit” then silence forever

At some point I thought, right, I’ll keep a log.  
Started tracking who I’d spoken to, what job it was for, if they followed up, and whether they ghosted me.

What began as a petty spreadsheet turned into something that’s… actually useful?  
Like a little job search CRM just for recruiters.

Now I’m wondering if I’m solving a niche problem only I care about, or if this kind of thing hits for others too.

Would love to hear:

* Have you ever tracked recruiter convos?
* Would something like this have saved you a headache?
* Or am I just over-organising my pain?

Not linking anything (I will not promote), just curious if this is a thing or a one-man spreadsheet rebellion.






95. Need advice: What do you do when your cofounder isn’t working out, but you’re not in a position to step in either? (i will not promote)
I’m a cofounder at a venture-backed startup. We’ve raised some capital, built a real product, and have a small team in place. But I feel stuck right now and unsure what the right next move is for the company or for myself.

We have less than a year of runway. Sales haven’t picked up the way we need them to. We’re planning to hire a senior sales person, but it’s a big expense and a high-risk hire. We don’t have much room for error.

The bigger problem is that our CEO isn’t stepping up. She’s not working hard enough, and when she does, it’s often not on the right things. I’ve tried to redirect and collaborate. At this point, I’m running nearly every part of the business on my own. product, finance, operations, hiring, investor updates, support, etc. I don’t think she’s the right person to lead the company, and I’m starting to feel like we won’t make it if something doesn’t change.

The issue is that I don’t want to be CEO either. I could do it for a while if I had to, but it’s not my long-term path. It’s not my skillset, and it’s not what I’m passionate about. My wife is also pregnant and I’m trying to plan for some kind of real parental leave at the end of this year, which makes stepping in even harder. I’m trying to do right by our investors, the team, and the company we’ve spent years building, but I don’t know how to solve this.

Do I push for a CEO change when we don’t have a clear successor?
Do I temporarily step in and risk burning out before the baby arrives?
Do I focus on sales and hope we can survive long enough to reset later?
Is there another option I’m not seeing?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through a messy cofounder situation or had to figure this out with limited time and resources. This has been keeping me up at night.

96. How much is your LLM API bill? I will not promote
If your product uses OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, etc.:

1. How much is your monthly bill?
2. What model(s) do you use?
3. How many requests per month?
4. What's your average number of tokens per request?
5. What percentage of "semantically similar" prompts do you process? I.e. not exact prompts word for word, but same meaning.

I'm trying to validate a product idea where these questions come into play.

97. Founder Reminder: You're NOT an Indentured Servant to your Startup (I will not promote)
Somewhere in the process, and I've dealt with this myself, I think Founders feel like they have become "indentured servants" to their startups.  

They forget they have freedom like anyone else.  They forget they can STOP doing things that hurt them financially, mentally and emotionally.

It's painful to watch.

At least a few times a week, I'm advising a Founder who is in an absolutely awful position where someone needs to just give them "permission" to stop hurting themselves.  They feel like they are trapped in their startup.

**Now, I'm not talking about simply forgetting your commitments because you don't feel like being responsible.**

**I'm talking about putting ourselves in a situation where it's actually destroying us.**

We build up this paralysis to the situation because we feel we've made commitments to investors, employees, co-founders, customers, and even our social circle at some level.  The idea of failing them seems way worse than destroying ourselves.

This isn't OK.  I've seen so many lives ruined, and a few taken, from this mentality.  

No one wants us to bury ourselves for the good of the company.  And those that do, don't deserve that fate from us (they mean us harm, and so, you know, f\*ck them).

If you're in a position right now where you feel like your startup is absolutely ruining you, remember you're not an indentured servant.  You have options.  If you're not sure what they are, ask other Founders with experience.  Hell, DM me or post something here and I'm sure anyone on this subreddit will help.    
  
I'm posting this because it pains me to watch so many Founders struggle with this issue, and I'm just throwing this out there in hopes that as a community we can help a few of you through this.

98. What actually worked when converting free users to paid? I will not promote

Hey everyone,
I’m working on a SaaS startup and we’ve started building a solid base of free users. Now we’re focusing on the harder part — getting them to upgrade to paid.

For those of you who’ve been through this, I’d love to hear:

What strategies or tactics helped you convert free users into paying ones?

Some specific things I’m curious about:

•	Did you use a paywall strategy — like making one key feature free and locking the next behind a paywall?

•	Did feature gating work better than usage limits or time-based trials?
	
•	What role did email sequences, in-app nudges, or personalized outreach play?
	
•	Were there any “aha moments” or value triggers that led users to convert?

Also wondering:

99. Startups that have Bricks and Mortar operations?  I will not promote
Hi everyone,

I'm wondering if anyone in the community has experience fundraising/running businesses that have a large Bricks and Mortar component. I feel like 95% of advice I see is angled towards digital businesses.

For background - I was a CEO for a startup (no equity) for 3.5 years in an emerging market in Asia. I built two large sports centers/academies that had memberships of 2000+ members each plus some casual users, and we also signed for another two locations whilst I was there. This was all privately funded by a rich investor and unfortunately started to be run like a family business which is why I left.

I'm now fundraising for a similar project, I have a contract to operate a great sports club that is being developed here and very good commercial terms. I'm trying to build a brand that will launch many clubs under one centralized management complete with customer facing app and dashboard developed onside. I have some options for investment (based on convertible debt) but I am still pushing to find an investor to buy 15% equity at about 800k USD which is enough for us to launch.

I'd love to talk with some of you who have stories about fundraising for physical businesses? Tell me your stories and maybe we can learn from each other

Thanks! (I WILL NOT PROMOTE) 






100. Is this enough traction for a seed round? (B2B SaaS) (I will not promote)
Hey everybody
I’m a solo founder working on a B2B SaaS product I launched at the very end of December 2024. Since then:

I already have 2 paying customers. One is a government organization and the other is a tech company.
8 other companies, some with hundreds of employees, reached out to me organically and are currently in a trial phase. They’ve already installed the software on their own servers.
All of this happened with zero paid marketing. Just a few Reddit posts (the best one had ~60 upvotes), and I’m still on page 3 of Google search.

I’m currently doing almost everything myself. I build the product, manage sales and support, and run the operations. I have a part-time designer I pay hourly, and I used to pay a few freelancers to help with the website.

My question is:
Is this level of traction enough to seriously pursue a pre seed round, or should I keep bootstrapping and push further before trying to raise?

I will not promote 

Edit: I meant pre seed round

1. Economists don't know what's going on
Blame crumbling statistical offices | Finance & economics
This startup idea could be a platform focused on providing better, real-time economic forecasting and crowd-sourced analysis. It could combine machine learning models with expert economic opinions and public predictions to better understand economic shifts, offering a more transparent and agile alternative to traditional models.

3. Watching o3 guess a photo's location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining
Watching OpenAI’s new o3 model guess where a photo was taken is one of those moments where decades of science fiction suddenly come to life. It’s a cross between the Enhance Button and Omniscient Database TV Tropes. The process is simple. Snap a photograph of somewhere, ideally without putting any obvious landmarks in there. Feed it to ChatGPT o3 (or o4-mini) and prompt “Guess where this photo was taken”. Let it churn.
A startup could emerge around "geo-intelligence AI" — a system that predicts a photo's location based only on visual clues. This could be used for security, media verification (checking fake news images), personalized travel recommendations, or immersive AR experiences. Concerns about surveillance would also need to be addressed ethically.

5. Show HN: My self-written hobby OS is finally running on my vintage IBM ThinkPad
A x86 32bit Hobby Operatingsystem with graphics, multitasking, networking and 32bit C-Compiler for i386 architecture. - joexbayer/RetrOS-32
This suggests a potential niche startup building minimal, open-source operating systems for vintage hardware. There’s a small but passionate market among retro computing fans. A community-supported OS marketplace, repair services, or even custom vintage laptop kits could come from this idea.

7. Bill Gates's Personal Easter Eggs in 8 Bit BASIC (2008)
If you type “WAIT6502,1” into a Commodore PET with BASIC V2 (1979), it will show the string “MICROSOFT!” at the top left corner of the screen. Legend has it Bill Gates himself inserted this easter egg “after he had had an argument with Commodore founder Jack Tramiel”, “just in case Commodore ever tried to claim that the code wasn’t from Microsoft”.

9. An end to all this prostate trouble?
The prostate gland causes entirely too many problems.  In the US,
prostate cancer kills about one man of every forty.  “Benign
prostate hyperplasia” (BPH) is even more common, affecting most
men over age 60.  It pinches the urinary tract, making it hard to
urinate, and is constantly in danger of transforming from
“benign” to “malignant”.  Even the difficulty urinating is enough
of a problem that men often get surgery for it, usually TURP, a
sort of roto-rooter job (except cutting through the pipe instead
of just cleaning it out). In women, breast cancer has a similar death toll, but the breasts
have an excuse: they’re much bigger; there are many more cells to
go bad.  They’re also much more metabolically active, capable of
producing enough milk to feed a baby; the prostate’s output is
tiny in comparison. One idea I’ve seen is that the prostate serves as the body’s
“gatekeeper” against sexually transmitted diseases, and in the
process often gets chronically infected itself; the resulting
inflammation may cause hyperplasia, first benign then malignant.
Infectious causation is too often neglected these days, and
sexually transmitted diseases are common, so this is not
unreasonable.  But it doesn’t seem like a great explanation.  The
prostate doesn’t filter the urinary tract; it just secretes into
it; there’s no real “gate” there to be “kept”.  The prostate’s
position is like that of the salivary glands, which are not known
for being great houses of cancer.  And the epidemiology backs
this up: correlations with STDs are there, but not huge.  The
odds ratios are between one and two; in comparison, the odds
ratio for human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer is
greater than ten.  An odds ratio of ten should make the ears perk
up; an odds ratio of 1.5 can be a minor effect or can be just a
spurious correlation.  And with the prostate, there’s not just a
minor effect which needs explaining: there has to be some
major-league cause.

13. The Seven-Year Rule
Years ago, I encountered a fascinating concept in a book by the Dalai Lama: every seven years, human beings transform into entirely new versions of themselves. This idea stems from the biological principle that our bodies replace virtually all their cells over a seven-year cycle. The person you are today doesn’t share a single cell with the version of you from seven years ago. (This is, of course, a generalization as some cells regenerate much faster and others a little slower.) There’s something profoundly liberating about this constant state of transformation. We often become fixated on our past: mistakes we’ve made, opportunities we’ve missed, harms inflicted upon us (and by us), or wounds we’ve suffered. But what if we truly internalized that the person who experienced those things no longer exists in a physical sense? I recently spoke with a friend who was still dwelling on something that happened thirty years ago. “Why do you care?” I asked him. “That was four versions of you ago. That person doesn’t exist anymore. Move on.”

15. California's $20 fast-food minimum wage improves pay at small cost to consumers
This could inspire a labor-tech startup focused on helping small food businesses manage wage increases better—automated payroll, scheduling optimization, loyalty programs to drive repeat customers, etc. Tools that help eateries stay profitable while paying fair wages.

17. Stuffed-Na(a)N: stuff your NaNs
Stuff your Na(a)N. Contribute to si14/stuffed-naan-js development by creating an account on GitHub.
This sounds like a playful tech/data science concept. It could become a serious startup around smarter missing-data handling systems. Machine learning companies always struggle with missing values (NaNs). A "smart stuffing" API that predicts and fills missing data automatically for ML pipelines could be huge.
